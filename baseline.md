# DevOps Baseline

An application's infrastructure is the backbone of its scale, agility, and velocity.  As such, the codebase surrounding the devops system should be maintained to the same quality and rigor as the application codebase.  By mirroring standard practices such as CI/CD, implementing a baseline of DevOps hygeine is practical and will lead to more reliable deployments, maintenance, and longterm management of even the largest scale systems.

## Validation

Whether your writing code for app development, web services, or high performance systems, your main allies in the fight for stability are your linter, compiler, and unit tests.  These tools serve to tell you that your code will work exactly as you anticipate when you deploy it to production.
